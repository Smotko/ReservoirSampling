Algorithm R and its improvements
	
	Algorithm R
		for simmilar data over time
		Simple implementation
		Lots of room for improvement
	
	Algorithm Z
		Simmilar to Algorithm R
		Improved perfomance
		Rejection technique
		Does not detect trends

Online learning
	Focus on recent data
	Constant feedback
	Good for endless streams
	
	Logistic regression
		Popular and widely used
		Classification algorithm
		Give a forecast of costs
		Fitting parameters

	Online AUC maximization
		AUC - Area Under ROC Curve
		Optimize pairwise loss
		AUC algorithms
			Use of Algorithms R and Z for sampling
			Needs more memorry
		
Frequent itemsets
	Automated data collection
	Vast amounts of data

	Sequential algorithms
		Apriori
		Eclat
		FP-Growth
			Depth first search
			Frequent pattern tree
			Simple estimates

	Parallel algorithms
		Many are based on the sequntial algorithms
		Parallel-FIMI (Parallel Frequent Itemset MIning)
			Universal method
			Easy to parallelize
			Easy load balancing

			Parallel-FIMI-SEQ
			Parallel-FIMI-PAR
			Parallel-FIMI-RESERVOIR
